# StreamMultiChat

## Idea
This application is designed to allow stream moderators and others to have multiple stream chats open in one cohesive stream of information allowing them to be more productive.
It allows for the user to select a single channel to respond or all channels. The app is a Work In Progress and will be gaining more features as time moves on.


## Setup
Currently your twitch username and oAuth token are required in appsettings.json (plan is to move this to a login button from twitch).

## Usage
On the main page when you start type in the channels you wish to connect to as comma seperated values and then click chat button.
Once in the chat page use the select box to set the channel you wish to chat in.
